There are three areas in git
1. The working area
2. The staging area
3. The local repository

1> The working area
	The working area is the area where you are currently working. It is where your files live.
 	The area is also known as the "Untracked" area of git.
	Any changes to files will be marked and seen in the working tree.
	Here you make changes and don't explicitly save them to git repository, you will lose the changes.
	If you make changes to files in your working tree git will recognize that they are modified, 
		and you will have to save those modified files by adding those to staging area.

2> The staging area
	The staging area is when git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files.
	To see what is in your staging area? Run the command "git status".
	How do you add files to your staging area from your working tree? 
		Run the command "git add <Filename>".
	Want to add everything from working tree, then run "git add ."
		The . operator is a wildcard meaning all files.

3> The local repository
	It is the area that saves everything.
	It is everything in your .git directory.
	Mainly all of your commits.
	How do you add files from your staging area to local repository??
		Run the "git commit" command
			takes all changes in the staging area, wraps them together and puts them in your
			local repository.
