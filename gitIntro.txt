what is git?

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 
It is primarily used for source code management in software development and was initially created by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux Kernel.

Git is not Github. 
Git is the version control software, and Github is a git repository hosting service which offers all the source code management provided in git. 
Github is where you upload your git repository.
