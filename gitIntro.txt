what is git?

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 
It is primarily used for source code management in software development and was initially created by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux Kernel.

Git is not Github. 
Git is the version control software, and Github is a git repository hosting service which offers all the source code management provided in git. 
Github is where you upload your git repository.

Characteristics of git

1. Support non-linear development
	Non-linear development allows yourself to work on different parts of system concurrently.
	May be you are working on the UI of your system and when you remember a bug in the back-end,
	you can save what you are working on , fix the bug and return to your previous work.

2. Distributed Development
 	Distributed development allows for multiple people to be working on the same project at the same time.
	Without version control system you would not be able to work on the same file.

3. Safeguards
	Everything saved in git is accessible at some later point. Even if you delete it!!
	There is a record of your save history.
	It is tough to corrupt your code.
